# Cobalt v2 Todos and Ideas

## High Priority

## Low Priority

- Auto Crafting (see #autocrafting)
- Look into porting to AHKv2

---

## Could be useful

- Go through and test how many waits are required (speed up macro?)
- Split macro into other files?
- Auto-update from remote server (could be seen as malicious)
- Heartbeat service to show how many people are using the macro (CloudFlare may not like it)

### Auto-crafting

Go towards, search for items for recipe, if you have items, start craft, set timer to check if its passed and go back when done
