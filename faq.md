## FAQ

### Will there ever be a paid version?
No, we do not plan on making a paid version and instead just simply accepting donations.

### The game updated and added a new seed when will the macro update???
Please be patient this is a passion project and we do not get paid for this. We will update as soon as we can typically within a maximum of 3 days but normally will update within 2 or 3 hours of Grow a Garden updating

### How do I report bugs?
Please first check the ⁠known-issues channel in discord, and if your issue isn't known please report them in ⁠support

### How can I support the macro if it's not paid?
Boosting the server or donations once they're set up.

### I have thought of a feature I want added, how do I go about pitching it?
Feel free to ping one of the developers on Discord with any ideas! And also read ⁠up-and-coming to see if your idea is already being considered!

### I tried editing the macro and it doesn't work any more, can I still get support for my edited version?
No, just use the base one at that point.

### Is the macro open source?
Yes! it is open source on GitHub (Licensed under AGPL 3).

### It keeps running out of Recall Wrenches what do I do???
Enable auto-buying Recall Wrenches it's the only real way.

### I scanned the file, why does it detect as a virus with Skyhigh?
We use a run command to open the private server link in your browser, it is completely harmless, if you do not trust us, look at the source code on GitHub.

### I'm on a system besides Windows will the macro work???
No, AHK does not support anything besides Windows.

### Can I send the macro to my friend?
Absolutely!

### How do I download the macro from GitHub? How do you get your discord ID?
Answer is in this video!

### Is AutoHotKey safe?
Absolutely, yes, it may be detected as unsafe because it has access to the same things viruses might exploit (sending web requests, running terminal commands, etc), the danger comes from the scripts you run. Cobalt is a completely safe script (see explanations above) and the code for Cobalt will always be open and readable.

## Common Solutions

### The macro doesn't really do anything besides move my camera around/When I start the macro it doesn't do anything then crashes/closes the game?
This is usually caused by a mismatched UI navigation keybind or not turning on the UI navigation feature. Another sign of this is when no blue box appears moving around on your screen. In settings make sure the UI navigation toggle is turned on and make sure the character it says in Roblox matches the one selected in the macro.

### The macro is not buying in stock items?
Make sure you do not have Windows Night Light or any other color altering settings enabled such as color blindness filters, inverted colors, etc.

### My settings wont save and the macro doesn't stop when I press f7
Extract the zip first and make sure you're running the one from the extracted file.
